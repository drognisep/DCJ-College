#DCJ College#

###Overview###
This is a project for the Step IT Up America program, during which myself, Chelsea Nett, and Jennifer Wu worked to 
create a basic college web site for students and instructors.

####General Features####
 * Built with Eclipse Kepler, runs on Tomcat 7.
 * Specialized DAO objects for retrieving data sets from the database using JDBC and Oracle 11g.
 * A 'roll-your-own' dependency injection scheme that enables database interaction classes to lazy load themselves
 with the proper implementation based on application configuration.
 * Vanilla JavaScript AJAX calls to update the view based on user interaction.
 * A decentralized controller role that allows for a more flexible design and proper separation of concerns.
